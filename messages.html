        <h1>Messages for Alia ❤️</h1>
        <p>I don’t even know where to begin because words will never be enough to express how much you mean to me. But I’ll try.</p>
        <p>Alia, thank you for being the best part of my life. I love you endlessly.</p>
        <p>With you, every day is special, and every moment is precious.</p>
        <p>I am so lucky to have you by my side, now and forever.</p>
        <p>Thank you—for everything. For your love, your kindness, your patience, and the way you make my world so much brighter just by being in it. You are my safe place, my happiness, and the most beautiful blessing I never knew I deserved.</p>
        <p>Through every smile, every laugh, and even the silent moments we share, you remind me that love isn’t just a feeling—it’s a home. And in you, I’ve found mine.</p>
        <p>I appreciate you more than I can ever put into words. For all the little things you do, the way you love me, support me, and stand by my side—I am endlessly grateful. I promise to always cherish you, to always choose you, and to love you in every way possible.</p>
